# Get Daily AoC Input

This is a simple script to download the input for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

You need to have the session cookie as environment variable. For example in an `.env` file.

Then copy pasta üçù the code from the [day1.js](./day1.js) file and change the parameter to the function with the corresponding day.

Have fun and good coding!
